@Narrative  As a User
            I want to be able to have an automated testing framework available which covers different
            scenarios for the Rates API

  Feature:
   Given Rates API for Latest Foreign Exchange rates
   When The API is available
   Then An automated test suite should run which will assert the success status of the response
